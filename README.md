# Sentiment Analysis Project

Sentiment analysis plays a vital role in understanding public opinion, brand perception, and customer feedback. However, working with high-dimensional embeddings generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can be computationally expensive, making clustering and classification tasks slower and less efficient.

This project aims to **evaluate the efficiency and scalability** of **random projection** to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings **before** sentiment classification. By doing so, essential semantic information can be retained while significantly improving processing speed and resource utilization.
