# Sentiment Analysis Project

Sentiment analysis plays a vital role in understanding public opinion, brand perception, and customer feedback. However, working with high-dimensional embeddings generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can be computationally expensive, making clustering and classification tasks slower and less efficient.

This project aims to **evaluate the efficiency and scalability** of **random projection** to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings **before** sentiment classification. By doing so, essential semantic information can be retained while significantly improving processing speed and resource utilization.

## How to Access the Repository

To get started with the repository, follow these instructions:

### 1. **Accessing the Repository**
   - **Clone the Repository:**
     You can clone the repository by running the following command 
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/AlbertJojo2313/BDA_FinalProject.git
     ```

   - **Access the Repository on GitHub:**
     You can visit the repository's GitHub page directly in their web browser:
     [https://github.com/AlbertJojo2313/BDA_FinalProject]

### 2. **Dataset**
   The dataset used for training the models is located inside the `data` directory. Group members can access and use this data for model training and testing.


### 3. **Creating a New Branch for Changes**
   If you to make changes or test something out, you can follow these steps to create a new branch and avoid affecting the `main` branch:

   - **Create and switch to a new branch:**
     After cloning the repository, you can navigate to the project directory and create a new branch using:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b new-branch-name
     ```

   - **Make Changes and Commit:**
    You can then make their changes in this new branch. After making changes, they should add and commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of the changes"
     ```

   - **Push the Branch to GitHub:**
     Once you have committed their changes, they should push the branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin new-branch-name
     ```
### 4. **Switching Back to the `main` Branch**
   If you want to return to the `main` branch, you can use the following command:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
