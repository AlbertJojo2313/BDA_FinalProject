This script uses the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to aggregate a dataset of movies and their associated reviews.
The script fetches reviews for a list of movie IDs stored in a text file, processes them in parallel using 
multiprocessing, and saves the aggregated data into a CSV file for further analysis.

The Movie Database (TMDb) provides access to a massive amount of movie metadata. This dataset is sourced from their public API.
